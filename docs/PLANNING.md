# COMP503 Project Planning

## Outline
This project will be a games collection catalouge. It will allow you to store, edit and remove games of various platforms, genres and release years. It will display a list of titles inputted by the user, and sorted using various methods. The user can rate games in their collection, at that rating can be compared to other games. 

The software will use the Chicken Coop API to help with populating fields, as information such as release year, platform, and images, as it can pull this information from the MetaCritic database from a game's title.

The UI will be powered by Java's Swing framework, as it is the easiest way to communcate with a Java backend. As one of the requirements of the project is console I/O, there will be a Java console UI built in, but hidden unless enabled through console arguments. Any subsequent builds of this project after assessment grading will be built on some type of web framework, most likely Electron, with either a Node.js or C# backend.
