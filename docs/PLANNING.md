# COMP503 Project Planning

## Outline
What will this project be? What will it accomplish?

## Project Structure (UML)

## Project Requirements

>#### Development Log
> A detailed log of the design, implementation and testing phases, detailing when work was done, how long it took,
> what was accomplished, and any problems encountered

>#### Java Source Code
> - Java console I/O 
> - File I/O
> - Relevant enumerated type utilisation

>#### Data Storage
> - Multiple collections 
> - Multiple collection algorithms

>#### Object Oriented Techniques
> - More than nine classes
> - Sensible relationships
> - Abstract and interface classes are utilised
> - Classes are encapsulated
> - Exceptions are used

>#### Runtime Execution
> - Meaningful, non-trivial problem is solved by the program
> - Program is interactive
> - Program is bug free

>#### Source Code Quality
> - Whitespace is consistent
> - All naming is sensible and meaningful
> - Comprehensively JavaDoc'd

## Miscellaneous Notes

- Part of the requirement for this program is to use Javaâ€™s Console I/O, however I what to develop this application with a
UI, so the plan currently is to develop both methods of interaction, and have the console interaction accessible via
command line arguments, so that the requirement can be met, without it getting in the way.
